Sensing Color: https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/how-to-sense-color-with-an-arduino/

This project uses photoresistors and phototransistors to sense different colors. The idea would be very useful to sort color inputs and change the date into a variety of outputs.

Here is a project that shows a machine that sorts candy by color: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7HTQai7Wwg
This project uses RGB sensors, IR distance sensors, and motors to sort the color.

Background of Idea: How do you help a blind person navigate a buffet line by helping them identify the contents of the food trays? 

# Week 3: Thursday, February 8, 2018

Homework:

Propose a device that does something "interesting". The assignment was previously to design a creative experimental musical instrument. I've decided to give you more freedom this sermester so you can apply the project to your specific interests. We will discuss project ideas in class and you can always email me if you need help deciding what to do. At minimum your project should make use of TWO input sensors and TWO kinds of output.
Describe the following in your Github repository:
Draw a sketch of your device that does something musical instrument
Describe the overall concept
Create a very rough schematic to the best of your ability
Describe what your program will do, to the best of your ability

Concept: The device I am proposing is an assitive technology that allows blind individuals to recogize food based on detecting color. The context would be a buffet where the individual canot different between the types of food available. Depending on the complexity, it would be interesting to make this project a multi-wearable accessory that also detects distance while in line. It would be interesting to create a device that augments more than one human ability; in this case, sensing distance and perhaps color/light.
