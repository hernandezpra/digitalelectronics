Sensing Color: https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/how-to-sense-color-with-an-arduino/

This project uses photoresistors and phototransistors to sense different colors. The idea would be very useful to sort color inputs and change the date into a variety of outputs.

Here is a project that shows a machine that sorts candy by color: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7HTQai7Wwg
This project uses RGB sensors, IR distance sensors, and motors to sort the color.

Background of Idea: How do you help a blind person navigate a buffet line by helping them identify the contents of the food trays?

### Concept
The device I am proposing is an assitive technology that allows blind individuals to recogize food based on detecting color. The context would be a buffet where the individual canot different between the types of food available. Depending on the complexity, it would be interesting to make this project a multi-wearable accessory that also detects distance while in line. It would be interesting to create a device that augments more than one human ability; in this case, sensing distance and perhaps color/light. 

Help blind individuals navigate a buffet line by helping them identify the contents of the food trays while also sensing the distance around the individual. 
  Will need to use some sort of distance sensor: most likely IR technology.
  Will need a color sensor.

I began testing my idea with a simple ultrasonic sensor with a vibration output to understand different modes of using haptic feedback. After testing this prototype I realized that the ultrasonic sensor does not work very well with soft materials so I changed it to a IR sensor. This allowed for more accurate measurements, however, I had to map out the readings from the sensor to match metric scale data.
