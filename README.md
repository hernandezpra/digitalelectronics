Sensing Color: https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/how-to-sense-color-with-an-arduino/

This project uses photoresistors and phototransistors to sense different colors. The idea would be very useful to sort color inputs and change the date into a variety of outputs.

Here is a project that shows a machine that sorts candy by color: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7HTQai7Wwg
This project uses RGB sensors, IR distance sensors, and motors to sort the color.

Background of Idea: How do you help a blind person navigate a buffet line by helping them identify the contents of the food trays?
